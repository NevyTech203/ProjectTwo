# ProjectTwo
This is my final project from Mod 7 in CS340

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  The way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is good spacing and flow. Ensure your inputs and calls are accurate. One extra space or inproper calls can throw the whole code off.
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  The best approach to a problem as a computer scientist is acceptance that there is an error and be open to the error being something small or big. Patience and commitment to the problem is how I made it through... Even when I had doubt that I would figure it out. The best advice I can give is embrace being wrong and accept that you will make errors. This is the way I learned. Now errors are a challenge for me to figure it out before I ask for help. 
  
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists create, maintain, and solve errors within computer software or an app or website. This can help a company secure their customers information and provide a user friendly platform for them to use.
